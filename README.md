# ETSystem Frontend

### This is the Frontend of a project built while studying WebDevelopment at Robert Bosch LTDA.

The framework used was React with Typescript along with many libraries such as axios, react-router-dom, react-hook-form, and some others. I would like to highlight the Material UI library, which is the reason why I made this project anyway, so I could learn the core components of MUI Core and MUI X.
The whole system was developed to manage a specific kind of school, where everything is measured by competences, a whole different approach from simple grades.
The Backend was coded with Typescript too, using Express and TypeORM.
